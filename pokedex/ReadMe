//Notes
//Determined that API call for multiple pokemon entries only returns name and url
//additional API calls are needed to get detailed info, might as well just do individual calls

//Issues to work on
//1. Add functionality to use 'enter' key - onKeyDown handler to input field - DONE
//2. Clear input field upon hitting submit key, issue with setInfo('') ln 36 - DONE
//3. Add functionality to compare user input with {pokemonName} - DONE
    //3A if(userInput.length !== 0) - prevent anything from happening when field is empty
    //3B if(userInput === pokemonName) - check if user is correct, if so return correct / incorrect!
//4. add button to generate new pokemon - DONE
//5. add show answer button if user gives up

//Future changes - 1. figure out css to grey out pokemonImg until user guesses
//Make it Pretty
